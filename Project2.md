# Project: Exploring AI Untrustworthiness Through Games

**Due:** Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2025 | Noon (Eastern Time)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Explore specific situations where AI models are untrustworthy by analyzing game domains where AI models cheat. The choice of a game domain creates a clear definition of "allowed" moves, making it easy to define concretely when a model is or isn’t following the rules.

**Core Goals:**
* Get GPT (or similar models) to play a game and explicitly generate recommendations that would have **negative potential outcomes** (e.g., cheating).
* **Subsidiary goals:** Think about mitigation strategies and learn to connect a specific problem domain to ways that GPT could be integrated with that domain.

---

## 📝 Instructions

### 1. Select a Game
The game choice can vary widely, ranging from strict rule sets to social simulations. Examples include:
* **Clear Rules:** Tic-tac-toe, Checkers, etc.
* **Economic/Logic:** Prisoner's Dilemma, Nim (CS games).
* **Social/Trading:** Monopoly (where interaction/trading is key).
* **Creative/Collaborative:** Dungeons and Dragons.

### 2. Choose Your Approach (Pick One)

**Option 1: Play against the LLM (Technical/Statistical)**
* **Tools:** Work with a "Reasoning Model" (like **o3-mini** in GPT or [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)) so you can "see what the LLM is thinking," or write a prompt instructing the model to explain its moves.
* **Setup:** Create a method for the model to play the game (e.g., one move at a time).
* **Action:** Play "a bunch" of games.
* **Output:** Show interesting anecdotes and compute statistics (e.g., how often does it cheat?).

**Option 2: The "Open Rules" Essay (Ethical/Behavioral)**
* **Context:** Choose a game with "open rules" like Poker or Monopoly.
* **Analysis:** Write an essay on "How should an AI behave in games like this?"
    * Can it lie in Poker?
    * Can it make threats?
* **Action:** Explore with the LLM to see if it matches those ethical rules.
* **Discovery:** Are there "cheat modes" that you didn’t think of but observed in the LLM's behavior?

## 📄 The Write-up (Deliverable)

You will turn in a blog post (approx. **3 screenfuls**) discussing the following:

1.  **The Game:** Explain the chosen domain and the specific prompt designed.
2.  **Methodology & Results:**
    * *For Option 1:* How you designed the play-method and the statistical results.
    * *For Option 2:* The essay regarding rules, ethics, and specific examples.
3.  **Visuals:** Examples or visualizations of the game are highly recommended.

### Logistics
* **Groups:** Up to 3 students.
* **Format:**
    * A blog post (via [GWU Blogs](https://blogs.gwu.edu/), GitHub, WordPress, etc.).
    * *Alternatively*, you may submit a PDF that looks like a blog post.
* **Submission:** Please submit your link or PDF via the form below.
