<h3>CSCI 6907 / EMSE 6992</h3>

<p>Classroom: SEH B1270.  This is one of the lecture halls in the basement of the SEH building (if you go in the building and go down the floor on the stairs, turn right at the bottom of the stairs).  
 </p> 
<p>Meets Mondays 3:30 -- 6:00.  It will often be the case that 3:30 -- 4:30 will be an invited speaker, and the rest of the class time will be filled by an in-class exercise.</p>

<p>Remote access.  This course is intended to be in person, but there is interest in the topic broadly beyond those in the course itself, and most of the guest lectures will be public.  If you are a student and for whatever reason can't attend, you can use this link.  Many classes will have in class exercises that are an important part of the learning; so this is not an invitation to treat this as a remote course.
